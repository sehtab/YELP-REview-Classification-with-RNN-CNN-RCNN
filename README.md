# Objective:

The objective of this ICP is to apply LSTM, LSTM-CNN, Bi-LSTM in dataset

# Approaches

A common dataset is analyzed with LSTM, LSTM-CNN, Bi-LSTM and efficiency is calculated

# Datasets

For dataset yelp_academic_dataset_review_100K.csv is used for Bi-LSTM analysis. yelp_academic_dataset_review_1M.csv is used for Use original labels instead of binary labels.

# Results:

Results are generated from tensorflow and sklearn and result is as below.

For the case of using original label, the result is as below:

# Challenges

Using original label, efficiency is getting very low.

# Planned Work

For this ICP, the dataset is embedded, convert to binary and then analyzed with LSTM, CNN-LSTM, Bi-LSTM. Then analyzed without binarization 
and analyzed with LSTM and Bi-LSTM.
